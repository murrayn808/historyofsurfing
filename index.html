<h1>A history of surfing</h1>
<h2><a id="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p> The first surfing references were found in Polynesia. Cave painting from the 12th Century show people riding on waves. In the course of seafarings, Polynesians brought surfing to Hawaii and the sport went viral. Surfing in Hawaii wasn't only a sport but also an important part of the religion. The tree choice was vital and religious rituals were practiced during the surf board shaping. The ceremonies served as protection and to secure the gods' goodwill. Everybody surfed - men, women, children, kings - but there was a strict rule system that regulated who could surf on which spot.

  The first written heritage about the history of surfing was found in James Cook's diary, the European captain who not only discovered new lands but also surfing.

  The colonization of Hawaii began shortly after that by means of Christian missionaries. The approach of life has been remarkable beforehand but after the settlement it changed a lot. The Hawaiians had to wear clothes and to visit the church frequently and the kids had to go to school. Surfing lost its strong influence in this time but never vanished completely.
